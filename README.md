Desription:
4 heroes must team up to defeat the evil dragon Valaxarus.

Ch 1: Attack on Mac

Valaxarus descended from the heavens to destroy Cafe Mac. The food was to be protected at all costs. Valaxarus, covered in hot lava, swooped down and began to assault cafe mac with its fire breath. Macalester stood no chance.


Ch 2: The Chase

The Chase was on. 
The four heroes rode their horses into the dark plains of the shadowload. 
As the village lights faded behind them, Archie took one last look as he drove his horse onward. 
It wasn't long before they came upon the lair of Valaxarus. 
The land was desolute. 
The ground cracked where dryness permeated the ground. 
They reached a bridge that crossed what looked like to be an old river. Joey's eyes traced the path of the river into a barren sea of sand.
